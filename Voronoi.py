TODO
- Next leaf and prev leaf need to handle when there isn't a left leaf to an internal node
- Handle Circle Event
- Cobble together the diagram

"""
Possible bugs: 
- if the sites fed to the circle algorithm are colinear
- getting next child of last node
- null checking the methods of BinTree
- circle event when arc is not under the site
